- micluster 1.3 provide ways to read data from Reader and InputStream, we could split the batch job into retreival, then clustering.

- Cannot run 2 jobs simultaneously as the (spring-batch) job definition is the same => create job definition programaticaly ?

- Can only keep the query cached while all services selected display the same BI count for the same query.
  If at least one differs, recompute the clustering (ask the user).
