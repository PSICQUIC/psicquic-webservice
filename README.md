# psicquic-webservice

This is the original Psicquic Reference Implementation which is able to index a MITAB 2.5 file and which is based on LUCENE. This implementation will not be further developed and the PSICQUIC reference implementation based on [SOLR](https://github.com/PSICQUIC/psicquic-solr-ws) should be used instead. You can find more information about how to install PSICQUIC using LUCENE [here](http://psicquic.github.io/HowToInstall.html).
